## **Explanation of Each File**

- **`cli.py`**: Main command-line interface where users interact with the application. Provides options for managing users, budgets, and expenses.
- **`models/database.py`**: Configures the SQLite database using SQLAlchemy and manages session creation for all models.
- **`models/user.py`**: Defines the User model and includes methods for user-related actions (e.g., creating, viewing, and deleting users).
- **`models/budget.py`**: Defines the Budget model and methods for managing user budgets.
- **`models/expense.py`**: Defines the Expense model and methods for tracking expenses.

## **Setup and Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Chege2004/python-cli-project.gitt
    cd python-cli-project
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Pipenv installed, then run:
    ```bash
    pipenv install
    ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    pipenv shell
    ```
